## About Me

My name is David Dickinson and wrote my first programs on an Apple IIe and I'm still here.  My other passion is acting.  If you're curious, [see some of my acting exploits](http://www.davidjdickinson.com).  

Right now I'm learning new things.  

## Projects

### [Frogger Game](https://biscaboy.github.io/frogger-game/)
Part of the web developer course at Udacity.  Try to cross the street and pick up some saphires, emeralds and diamonds along the way.  All this helped me learn about object oriented programming in Javascript.

### [Memory Game](https://biscaboy.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/)
Part of the web developer course at Udacity.  Try to match cards to test your memory.  I got to learn about media queries, CSS animation and practice CSS layouts and class manipulations in HTML5.

### [Interactive Resume](http://biscaboy.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume/)
Another Udacity web developer project this time with some of my actual technical experience.

### [Responsive Design Portfolio](http://biscaboy.github.io/portfolio/)
Another single web page project with some links that got me using CSS responsively.

### [Hello World](https://biscaboy.github.io/hello-world/)
Practicing with Git, GitHub, [GitHubPage](https://biscaboy.github.io/) and GitHub Desktop.
