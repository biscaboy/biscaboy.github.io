## About Me

My name is David Dickinson and wrote my first programs on an Apple IIe and I'm still here.  My other passion is acting.  If you're curious, [see some of my acting exploits](http://www.davidjdickinson.com).  

Right now I'm learning new things.  

## Projects

### [Frogger Game](https://biscaboy.github.io/frogger-game/)
Part of the web developer course at Udacity.  Try to cross the street and pick up some saphires, emeralds and diamonds along the way.  All this helped me learn about object oriented programming in Javascript.

### [Memory Game](https://biscaboy.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/)
Part of the web developer course at Udacity.  Try to match cards to test your memory.  

### [Hello World](https://biscaboy.github.io/hello-world/)
Practicing with Git, GitHub, [GitHubPage](https://biscaboy.github.io/) and GitHub Desktop.
