## About Me

My name is David Dickinson.  I wrote my first programs on an Apple IIe (anyone remember Logo?), and I still love seeing computers come alive with some lines of code.  My other passion is acting.  If you're curious, [checkout some of my acting exploits](http://www.davidjdickinson.com).  I have some [good experience in software and IT](https://linkedin.com/in/david-j-dickinson) too (scroll way down).

I'm still learning.  To update my Java and Front End skills I recently took some [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses.  

## Udacity Student Projects

 * Security using Java Web Tokens (JWT)
