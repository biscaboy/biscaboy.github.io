## About Me

My name is David Dickinson and wrote my first programs on an Apple IIe and I'm still here.  My other passion is acting.  If you're curious, [see some of my acting exploits](http://www.davidjdickinson.com).  

Right now I'm learning new things, starting with Git.  

## Projects

### [Hello World](https://biscaboy.github.io/hello-world/)
Like I said, I'm restarting with how to use Git, GitHub, [GitHubPage](https://biscaboy.github.io/) and GitHub Desktop.

_Thanks for reading!_
