## About Me

My name is David Dickinson.  I wrote my first programs on an Apple IIe (anyone remember Logo?) and I still love seeing computers come alive with some lines of code.  My other passion is acting.  If you're curious, [checkout some of my acting exploits](http://www.davidjdickinson.com).  

I'm still learning.  Here are some projects I've done lately...

## Udacity Student Projects

### [Super*Duper*Drive Cloud Storage](https://github.com/biscaboy/cloudstorage)
This project is part of the Java Web Developer course.  I created a website using  
[Spring](https://spring.io),
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) 
the [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/), 
the [MyBatis](https://mybatis.org) ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework,
the [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) testing framework,
the [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) WebDriver for integration testing and 
the IntelliJ IDE.

### [Frogger Game](https://biscaboy.github.io/frogger-game/)
Part of the web developer course at Udacity using HTML5 and Javascript.  Try to cross the street and pick up some saphires, emeralds and diamonds along the way using an object oriented design in Javascript.

### [Memory Game](https://biscaboy.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/)
Part of the web developer course at Udacity using HTML5 and Javascript.  Try to match cards to test your memory.  Exercised media queries, CSS animation, CSS layouts and class manipulations.
