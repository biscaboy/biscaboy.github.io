# David J. Dickinson's GitHub Repository

## About Me

I've been programming since the late 80's but taken some big breaks to be a performer.  If you're curious, [see some of my exploits as an actor](http://www.davidjdickinson.com).  I started progamming in BASIC in High School, My golf coach Mr. Murphy was my first instructor.  I'm so grateful to that man.  He got me started on a path that I didn't realized I'd enjoy so much.

I've used other source code repositories and am really enjoying using Git.  It's the first stop as I'm updating my skills here at the end of 2017 and into 2018.

I've posted some project here, but things are a bit messy at the moment.  Nothing too profound.  Some code from Udacity courses and a website or two for firends.


_Thanks for reading!_


*I'm leaving this welcome message up for myself for the moment for the reference to Markdown becuase I need it.
